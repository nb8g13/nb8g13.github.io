### Who Am I?

I am a postodctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. More specifically, 
I work within the Department of Computer Science on the Large Agent Collider (LAC) 
project. During my PhD at the Univeristy of Southampton, I studied a variety of problems at the intersection of mechanism design and machine learning under the joint supervision of 
Prof Long Tran-Thanh and Prof. Enrico Gerding.

I am currently focused on applying state-of-the-art machine
learning methods to rapidly calibrate, analyse and validate agent-based models (ABMs) of large-scale complex systems. My recent work includes the use of generalised variational inference to search for realistic synthetic populations, 
and finding interpretable surrogate models for ABMs through causal abstraction. 

### What is the LAC Project?

The overarching technical goal of the LAC project is to effect a step change in our ability to develop and deploy robust large scale agent-based simulations by leveraging techniques from AI and machine learning. The LAC project is supervised jointly by Prof. Michael Wooldridge, Prof. Ani Calinescu, and Prof. Doyne Farmer.

### Contacting Me
If you are an agent-based modeller interested in how machine learning might be applied
to your problem, or conversely a machine learning specialist interested in dicussing the unique challenges ABMs present, feel free to shoot me an email.

### Other Stuff
I maintain a blog post on this website which aims to provide updates about recently accepted papers. I also occassionally write about general ideas in machine learning that pique my interest. Additionally, I am fairly active on <span style="color:blue">Twitter</span>.
